# Car Rental Project

The Car Rental project is a comprehensive MERN stack web application tailored for small rental companies. It encompasses end-to-end functionality, including user authentication, booking management, and admin features. This application is built using Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Redux, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## Project Features

- User authentication for secure access to the platform.
- Booking management system for efficient rental services.
- Admin dashboard with specialized features for company management.

## New Features

### Customer Ratings and Feedback System

We've implemented a comprehensive car rating and feedback system that allows users to:

1. **Rate Cars**: After completing a booking, users can rate their car rental experience on a 5-star scale.
2. **Leave Feedback**: Users can provide detailed comments about their experience.
3. **View Car Ratings**: All cars display their average rating in the car list and detail views.
4. **View Feedback Statistics**: A new dashboard shows overall rating statistics, distribution, and top-rated cars.

#### Implementation Details:

- **Feedback Form**: After successful payment, users have the option to rate the car.
- **Rating Storage**: All ratings are stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence.
- **Car Preview**: Added a car preview feature to see more details before booking.
- **Rating Indicators**: Cars with feedback have additional indicators in the listings.
- **Rating Dashboard**: A summary dashboard on the user's bookings page shows rating statistics.

### Other Improvements

- Changed currency symbol from $ to â‚¹ for the Indian market
- Fixed fuel type filtering to handle different casing formats
- Added proper error handling in various components
- Improved the UI/UX with detailed car previews and better feedback
